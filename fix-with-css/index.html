		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>The website I chose to improve its usability are <a href="http://www2.pnwx.com/" target="_blank">Pacific Northwest X-Ray Inc.</a> for the first two improvements and <a href="https://ukraine.craigslist.org/" target="_blank">Craigslist</a> for the third. Although they may seem like okay websites, improvements can be made to allow for better usability. Below includes screenshots of the websites being modified in an attempt to fix a usability dimension. Here is the css file for the improvements for you to test <a target="_blank" href="website.css">(cssFile)</a> </p>

		<div style="margin-top: 100px;">
			<h2 id="Improvement1">Improvement 1</h2>
			<p>The first improvement focuses on fixing the websites learnability on the homepage. As it stands, the color for the background is not apealing making the words hard to see especially towards the middle with the contents to click on. So by changing the background color of the table with its contents and making it a little wider, allows readability making it more visible and learnable especially by users whose eyesight are not too good.</p>
			<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; justify-content: space-between; margin-left: 10px; width: 500px;">
				<div>
					<div><h3>Before</h3></div>
					<div style="margin-right: 30px;"><img src="images/original1.png" alt="O1" width="570px" height="400px"></div>
				</div>
				<div>
					<div><h3>After</h3></div>
					<div><img src="images/improvement1.png" alt="I1" width="570px" height="400px"></div>
				</div>
			</div>

			<h2 id="Improvement2">Improvement 2</h2>
			<p>The next improvement works on the efficiency usability dimension on the homepage. As shown in the before below, the search bar and button is small and makes it kind of difficult to manuever especially on mobile devices. So by making it a bit bigger and inline with the arrow, allows users to efficiently search without the need to zoom in.</p>
			<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; justify-content: space-between; margin-left: 10px; width: 500px;">
				<div>
					<div><h3>Before</h3></div>
					<div style="margin-right: 30px;"><img src="images/original2.png" alt="O2" width="570px" height="250px"></div>
				</div>
				<div>
					<div><h3>After</h3></div>
					<div><img src="images/improvement2.png" alt="I2" width="570px" height="250px"></div>
				</div>
			</div>

			<h2 id="Improvement3">Improvement 3</h2>
			<p>For the third improvement on the Craigslist website homepage, as seen in the before screenshot, it is really congested. The fonts are small and there is very little line spacing. So by improving those, the safety usability dimension is improved so that slips error type does not occur which for example you try to click a certain link but click another by mistake because they are so close together.</p>
