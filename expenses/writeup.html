<h2>Write Up</h2>
<p style="line-height: 25px;">The differences between the spreadsheet-like app and my newer app are that my app doesn't allow editing of data once entered like the spreadsheet one. It uses a form to get users information. It provides feedback like if data is missing or a prompt to ensure the information added is what you want to add and is added to the table with all payments made. At the top it displays how much one person owes the other and updates when additional information is added. It supports 3 currencies and the total amount owed is in BZD($).</p>
